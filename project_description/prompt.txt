Backend Assessment: AI Agent Platform

Overview

This assessment evaluates your skills as a backend software engineer. You will design and implement a

backend service for an AI Agent Platform, enabling users to create, manage, and interact with AI agents via

text and voice. The platform will integrate with OpenAI APIs for chat, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech

functionalities.

You are expected to demonstrate proficiency in Python, RESTful API design, database modeling, third-party

API integration, and best practices in code quality, testing, and documentation. You are encouraged to use AI

tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) to assist your workflow



Functional Requirements
1. Agent Management
Users can create, update, and list AI agents.
Each agent has a name and a prompt (system message)

2. Chat Sessions
Users can start and manage multiple chat sessions per agent.
Each session stores a chronological history of messages between the user and the agent.
3. Messaging
Users can send text messages to an agent within a chat session.
The backend should use OpenAI's API to generate agent responses.
All messages (user and agent) are stored in the database with timestamps.
4. Voice Interaction (Asynchronous)
Users can record and send a complete voice message (e.g., via a push-to-talk button that sends
the file upon release).
The backend receives an audio file, converts it to text (Speech-to-Text), generates a chat
response, and converts that response back into an audio file (Text-to-Speech).
The final audio response is sent back to the client to be played. This is an asynchronous
request/response model, not a real-time stream.
5. API Documentation
Provide interactive API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) for all endpoints.
6. Testing
Implement tests to cover core backend functionality.
7. Postman Collection
Supply a Postman collection for testing all API endpoints.
8. Deployment
Provide a Dockerfile to containerize the backend service.
Include a requirements.txt listing all dependencies.
9. Documentation
Write a clear README.md with setup, configuration, and usage instructions.
10. (Optional) Simple Web Interface
(Bonus) Provide a minimal frontend to interact with your backend.
Technical Requirements
Language: Python 3.10+
Framework: FastAPI (preferred) or similar
Database: SQLite (or any SQL database)
ORM: SQLAlchemy (async recommended)
OpenAI Integration: Use provided API key for chat, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech

API Design: Use standard REST principles for interactions, including file uploads for voice messages.
Testing: pytest or unittest
Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI (auto-generated by FastAPI or similar)
Containerization: Docker
Evaluation Criteria
Functionality: Completeness and correctness of the backend features
Code Quality: Structure, readability, maintainability, and use of best practices
Testing: Coverage and reliability of tests
Documentation: Clarity and completeness of API docs and README
Deployment: Ease of setup and containerization
Deliverables
Source code for the backend service
Database models and migration scripts (if any)
API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
Postman collection for API testing
Test suite with instructions to run tests
Dockerfile and requirements.txt
README.md with setup and usage instructions
a short video showing the functionality of the backend service.
(Optional) Simple frontend for demonstration
